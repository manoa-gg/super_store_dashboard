# super_store_dashboard
I created an excel dashboard using super store datasets from kaggle
As usual I start from cleaning the data from inconsistencies, blank space, and null
The data I acquire already pretty much cleaned with only little adjustment needed like trim and others. I use tools like find & search, conditional formatting, and formula like proper to modify text in columns
After that I transform number from text, date to its format, extracting days of the week & month, currency from number, and create data validation to lock for option inside several columns
Beginning with 20 columns I transform the dataset to 25 to suit my analysis
For analysis I create pivot chart over company data from 2019-2020 and against the data between sales, quantity of order, sales, and profit. There are also pie chart distribution of segment, category of goods, percentage of payment mode, and other
I also create map to see the distribution of customers based on state in US
There are also bar chart over number of days processing, top 10 most profitable goods, and top 10 most profitable consumers while also adding timeline to track company progress in month and year
Finally all are compiled inside new worksheet act as a dashboard to have full and clear overview of all the metrics created and can be filtered by time or added with new data to track company progress
